# REE-Sound-Board
A free, customizable sound board with global hotkeys and sound filters!

It's very simple and user-friendly; simply click the + on the main window and open a sound file in the new window that appears!
Optionally, you can set an image file, adjust the volume or even set a global hotkey that fires the sound even when in most apps or games.

The sound board can also output two audio devices, which is useful for people who use Virtual Audio Cables as their microphone in order to apply effects and filters to their mic.
